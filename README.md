# EEG Sonify
[![report](https://img.shields.io/badge/Report-pdf-lightgrey)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/artur-deluca/eeg_sonify/blob/master/Report.pdf)

This repository contains an ongoing work in turning EEG recordings into sounds.

These sounds can be used in BCIs as auditory feedback for any particular activity recorded by the EEG.
Another use is to warn technicians of unwanted artifacts during a session. In these cases, particular sound patterns could quickly indicate a problem during a trial rather than constantly surveilling all EEG leads, which could avoid the removal of such potential faulty epochs during post-mortem.

The data used for this task was extracted from [Appelhoff et al. (2018)](https://osf.io/cj2dr/wiki/home/)
